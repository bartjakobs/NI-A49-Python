# Native Instruments A49 keyboard driver in Python!

I have created a Python driver for the Native Instruments A49 keyboard. I don't really like the KOMPLETE KONTROL software, but I do like the display and the PLAY and STOP buttons. So I decided to write my own driver in Python.

The keyboard part of the keyboard is just a MIDI controller, but the buttons and the display are a HID device. 


## Watch:

Or run ```dvd.py``` to see the display in action.


## Installation
Copy the files somewhere, install hid and pillow and run the script.
